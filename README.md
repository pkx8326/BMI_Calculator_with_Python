# BMI_Calculator_with_Python
This repository contains 2 Python programs. The first program calculates the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight (in kilogram) and height (in meter). 

Both program demonstrate simple arithmetic calculations in Python and PEMDAS (parentheses, exponential, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction) calculation order in action.

The second program also demonstrates the ability to categorize BMI into 5 health categories via "if, elif, else" conditional clauses.
